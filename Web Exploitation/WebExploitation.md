## Ancient History (10 pts)

This problem is no longer available in the picoGYM to redo but the general idea was that going to the link in the problem sequentially redirected to new web pages. The flag was obtained by repeatedly clicking the back button in the browser and noting the last letter of the url (the file name). Backwards, they were the flag.

## GET aHEAD (20 pts)

    Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/
    Hint 1: Maybe you have more than 2 choices
    Hint 2: Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses
Using Burpsuite (proxy>open browser), we notice that clicking the website buttons prompts different HTTP methods. Clicking “choose red” causes a GET request to be sent to the server and clicking “choose blue” causes a POST request to be sent.
Looking at the hint “Maybe you have more than 2 choices” and the interesting capitalization in the challenge title (GET aHEAD) - and an undisclosed amount of googling - we come to the idea of a HEAD request (another type of HTTP request, which only requests _header_ information).
Taya then does some kind of magical inferring or something and realizes that entering `$ curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/` in the webshell displays the flag in its output:
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_82880908}
    Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

## Scavenger Hunt (50 pts)

    There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?
    Hint: You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.
The key idea of this problem is accessing the web files of a website through URLs. When a website is made, it is composed of several different pages, each one saved as a file. The hardest part of this problem was finding the file names with the hints given…
Viewing the source code of the site given gives the first part of the flag:
![scavenger hunt 1]!(C:/Users/girls/Pictures/Git-PicoCTF-2021-Images/scavenger-hunt-1.png "To view a page's source code")
![scavenger hunt 2]!(C:/Users/girls/Pictures/Git-PicoCTF-2021-Images/scavenger-hunt-2.png "Part of the page's source code")
